Firebase Realtime Database Authentication
This project integrates Firebase Realtime Database to authenticate users.
The project has really eye-catching UI.
It registers user through phone number and logs in with phone number and password.
On successful login/signup, user is directed to the homepage which shows info about all the users.
Enjoy!!
